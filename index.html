          <p>Currently, I am working on BiBli
                robot for ROBAUTO.INC, BiBli is an intelligent
                autonomous robot that is designed to be low-cost and
                accessible to all educators. It is part of an overall
                project to help map autism.</p>

                BiBli, the educational robot with ROBAUTO.INC. The robot
                is built for potential Autism rehabihation, to improve
                the social skills of kids with Autism. So far, I have
                helped built two generations of BiBli. The first
                generation is now a permanant part of Longmont Library.
                And we are making prototypes, trying to cover all the
                libraries in Boulder, Longmont, Lyon, making BiBli the
                first robot to be checked out at a library. BiBli can be
                remotely controlled by a web user interface, equipped
                with a customizable video, audio media center to allow
                customers to build their own media curriculum.<br>

                A remote, voice activated robotic arm. The robotic arm
                is built to help grab things in room. It can be mounted
                to a mobile robot base to move around. Additionally, to
                make it convinient to control. A mobile application was
                designed to control it remotely via Bluetooth. It was
                built with Owi Robottic Arm Edge and Raspberry Pi. I
                wrote a control algorithm with python to receive the
                command from remote tablet and then convert the command
                into the code which can be executed by arm control
                module. Then I can remote control the robot arm on my
                phone. After adding voice input for the app, I can even
                use voice to control the robot arm.</p>

                As a vonlunteer mechanical designer. I designed a

                Colorado, Boulder. The robotic arm was designed to trim,
                water plants that are cultivated in space station for
                scientific experiment . so the robot will work in an
                environment that is different from on the ground. we
                must ensure the arm is stable and accurate enough that
                can reach and cover every branch of the plant.</p>
